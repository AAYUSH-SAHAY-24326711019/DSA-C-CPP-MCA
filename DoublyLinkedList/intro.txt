=>task 1 making the menu<= (testing) (done)<=
=>Task 2 representation of the doubly linklist.<= (done)
=>Task 3 creation of an empty doubly link list<=(adding in menu) (testing) (done)
=>Task 4 Traversal operation in the list can be done
    in both forward as well as backward manner. (operation 3 in menu)

    implementing the functions (done)
    We will also need to implement the add function in order to test it,

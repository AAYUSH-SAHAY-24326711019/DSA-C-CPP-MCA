of the operations for single linked list,

Thankyou


==>Task 1 (implementation of Menu) <==
Now adding the main menu in the program
testing the menu
we will add the functions one -by -one
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 2 creating a single link list<=
1. create the structure of node
2. create the head pointer assign it as null.
3. create the empty link list , 
    by function c_list that takes the head pointer as argument
    Since, an empty list has no node , the head ptr is null.
4. calling the function in the main function menu
5. The single link list was created .
=========[Task completed]========

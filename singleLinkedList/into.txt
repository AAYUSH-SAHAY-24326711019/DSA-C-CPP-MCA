has important functions illustrating the implementation
of the operations for single linked list,

Thankyou


==>Task 1 (implementation of Menu) <==
Now adding the main menu in the program
testing the menu
we will add the functions one -by -one
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 2 creating a single link list<=
1. create the structure of node
2. create the head pointer assign it as null.
3. create the empty link list , 
    by function c_list that takes the head pointer as argument
    Since, an empty list has no node , the head ptr is null.
4. calling the function in the main function menu
5. The single link list was created .
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 3 to insert the nodes<=
1. Nodes can be inserted in 2 ways , from the start and from back.
2. make it in menu. (done)
3. making function to add in the end : ins_end()(done)
4. to test it add the traverse function(done)
5. testing the insert at end(done)
6. adding function to add in the start : ins_beg()
7. adding to menu and testing..(done)
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 4 to insert after a particular number<=
1. adding it in the menu (done)
2.we will need to implement search and get location of desired node.(done)
    now making the function of inserting after ins_aft().
    we pass the head ptr, after specifice element and what item to be added.
    (done)
3. testing (done...)
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 5 : searching if list sorted.<=
1. if our list is sorted , then we will save our time in searching
    elements.
2. Adding to the menu (done).
3. implementing search2() (done)
4. adding it to the menu and show the location value address and value (done)
5. testing with unsorted values. list : [12]-[10]-[24]-[ 4]-

        searching in unsorted list

        User provide input =10
        [10],(address : 007C1AC8)
testing with sorted list

traversing a single linklist
[10]-[20]-[30]-[40]-[50]-
User provide input =40
[40],(address : 00C31AE8)

Tested in both sorted as well as unsorted manner (done)
=========[Task completed]========

=>Task 6 To implement deletion operation in single linklist<=
1. Adding in the menu of the program(done)
2. deltion from begining : del_beg() needs the head pointer
    adding in menu and testing
    Deleting node from begining
        [10]-[20]-
        New List :[20]-

    (done)
